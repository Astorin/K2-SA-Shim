# Krastorio 2 DLC Features Addon

This is an unofficial addon for Krastorio 2 that adds a few features from Factorio: Space Age to the mod.

It does not add compatability between Factorio: Space Age and Krastorio 2. Factorio: Space Age must be purchased, but not enabled for this mod to function.

## Features

- "Power armor MK3" and "Power armor MK4" are now "Mech armor" and "Mech armor MK2". Their stats are the same, but they have the flying ability of mech armor.
- Superior inserters, superior long inserters, and superior loaders all have belt stacking.
- Uses the [Stack Inserters](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/stack-inserters) mod for pre-superior-tier stack inserters and belt stacking research.
